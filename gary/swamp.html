    <p id="textPlaceHolder">Disoriented you fall to your knees. Standing up you realize you are no longer in the room. You have been teleported! Crickets and frogs are the only sounds that break the silence of the night. Dark woods and fetid water lay to your left and right. Definitely suicide to go that way. A trail leads over the soggy ground deeper into the woods. </p>
