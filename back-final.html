<h1>Back Room</h1>

<!--Add your description into the description below.-->

<p>Laid out before you is a room filled with all sorts of items. There is a dresser to the right of you. A door is to the left of you. You see a chalice on the dresser. In a darkened corner you see an old-worn sofa. The couch drinks in the light of the room hungrily.</p>
<p>This is your room of relief. Share your all kind of story shortly. Express love or confess for someone with name which will be hidden with key.</p>
</br>
<p>What will you do now?</p>
