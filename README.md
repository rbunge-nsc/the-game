###CURRENT ASSIGNMENT IN PROGRESS
* Assignment 8
* For this assignment, you are going to make one specific change to your group's project. You will log each action you take in making and managing this change. As a deliverable for this assignment, upload a file documenting your complete history in making and managing this change.

Here is your process outline:

Update your local repository with the lastest version of the group's project. 
Make a branch and modify at least one file from the group's project.
Run a diff command to document what is different between your version of the file and the previous version. 
Merge your change into the group's project.
Now reverse your changes. 
For each process above, document how you did it and what was the result. 


Our thanks goes out to Robert Bunge and the others for the use of their code base. Thank you!!
