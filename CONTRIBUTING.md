# Welcome!

Welcome to group2's version of the-game! This is an open source project for students in IT 115. The goal of the project is to make a bunch of web application code so we can all practice managing this code on GitHub. 

## Environment Details

Part of the class is to explore different development environments. This repository will be for code contributions from our group. The class is divided into groups and we were all uploading files to the fork of our instructors repository(theGaryLarson/the-game). Now the code lives in this fork and we applying all our changes to this repository.
There is a directory for each room. Our group should  contribute code to the forked repository for his/her group. The GitHub security model allows each contributor access to the entire repository, but please be responsible and follow the file structure laid out in the section, Workflow contribution process. If you are unsure after reading just open a pull request and a collaborator will review before merge. If there are any issues comments will be left under the discussion tab of the pull request. After you read it please leave a comment acknowledging you read it and fix the changes in the branch created for that pull request and reopen another pull request commenting on fixed issue.

This is going to be a web application. The directory structure will work like a tree.
